# Hi! My name is RaÃºl Garcia ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I finished my degree on IT in 2014, after a small period working as a web developer, in 2015 I started as ABAP developer. After a few years working with ABAP I was moved to integration team, working mainly with SAP Cloud platform integration. Since 2018 I have been working in different projects implementing interfaces for different customer in Europe and North America. In 2020 I also started to work with Workforce software implementing interfaces with different trhid party systems. 

Even I have been working with SAP for long time I am also interesting in learning other programing languages and technologies. I take all oportunities that I have to learn new things and try to apply to my personal projects. 

Actually I am living in Granada (Spain) one of the most beautiful cities in Spain.

## Personal Projects

+ [**Mi coleccion**](https://raulg91.pythonanywhere.com/) This is a flask apllication that will allow you to organise your videogame collection. Users can create a profile and store all new items added to his/her collection. It will make easy to get all details about your videogames collection, such as price, platform, state, etc... Flask app uses a MySQL database to store all the information about users and items. Frontend is done using HTML and CSS. It is still under contruction!
+ [**Weeding website**](https://www.bodamariaraul.net) I got married on April 13th 2024, so I created a small website with information about the event and also a form to confirm assitance. It also uses Flask in combination wiht HTML, CSS and Javascript. The information about invitees is store in a Google sheet, which make easy to modify or check it. I used APIs provided by Google to achieve it. This application is deployed into Google cloud. 
+ [**Pollen app**](https://pollen_app-blue-moon.reflex.run/): This application will show the pollen levels for all towns in Andalucia, Spain. Based on the province user will select the town and it will show pollen levels for next 5 days. The application is done with [**Reflex**](https://reflex.dev/) which is Python framework that allow us to create websites using pure python. To get pollen levels Google API is used. The application is deployed using the hosting provided by Reflex.
+ [**F1 API**](https://github.com/raulG91/f1_api): This is an API created using [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/). It will allow to manage information about a F1 season. To persist the information a MongoDB database will be used.
+ [**Granada Sport Backend**](https://github.com/raulG91/granada_sport_backend): This aim of this app is to publish sport event in a specific city. Users can check the events that will occur in the following days and participate on those events. The app will work as a placeholder for sport enthusiasts. App is done using FastAPI. Based on the use cases different endpoints have been created. The app will require user to autheticate to make some actions. To persist the data, Mysql database will be used. A Docker container has been created to run the application where the user wants.
