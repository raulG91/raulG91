# Hi! My name is RaÃºl Garcia ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I finished my degree on IT in 2014, after a small period working as a web developer, in 2015 I started as ABAP developer. After a few years working with ABAP I was moved to integration team, working mainly with SAP Cloud platform integration. Since 2018 I have been working in different projects implementing interfaces for different customer in Europe and North America. In 2020 I also started to work with Workforce software implementing interfaces with different trhid party systems. 

Even I have been working with SAP for long time I am also interesting in learning other programing languages and technologies. I take all oportunities that I have to learn new things and try to apply to my personal projects. 

Actually I am living in Granada (Spain) one of the most beautiful cities in Spain.

## Personal Projects

+ [**Mi coleccion**](https://raulg91.pythonanywhere.com/) This is a flask apllication that will allow you to organise your videogame collection. Users can create a profile and store all new items added to his/her collection. It will make easy to get all details about your videogames collection, such as price, platform, state, etc... Flask app uses a MySQL database to store all the information about users and items. Frontend is done using HTML and CSS. It is still under contruction!
+ [**Weeding website**](https://www.bodamariaraul.net) I will get married on April 13th 2024, so I created a small website with information about the event and also a form to confirm assitance. It also uses Flask in combination wiht HTML, CSS and Javascript. The information about invitees is store in a Google sheet, which make easy to modify or check it. I used APIs provided by Google to achieve it. This application is deployed into Google cloud.
